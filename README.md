# Basic Portfolio Website 🌐  
### Initial Version – Front-End Web Development Project

This project is my **old and basic version of a personal portfolio website**, created during the **initial stage of my web development learning**.  
It is a **front-end only project**, built using simple **HTML and CSS**, focusing on structure rather than advanced design or frameworks.

## 📌 Project Overview

This portfolio website was developed as a **beginner-level project** to practice:
- HTML page structuring

It represents my **starting point in web development**, before moving on to more advanced and modern portfolio designs.
